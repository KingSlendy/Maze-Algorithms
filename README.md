Animations of every maze algorithm in C#  
Here is the video of where I showcased how each maze is generated: [The color of Maze Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4BNQEnIrz0)  
  
This project took huge inspiration from this video: [The Sound of Maze Generation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3mymCWzhV8)  
Here is the source code from the video above: [Source](https://github.com/odedw/sound-of-maze-generation)  
Thanks to them for inspiring me to do this!

A huge thanks to this blog too!: [Maze Generation](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/2/7/maze-generation-algorithm-recap)  
For helping me understand how the algorithms worked.

Most of the algorithms I made them myself with only knowing how the algorithm itself worked (except for Recursive Division).  
So it's most likely that an implementation of one of these is wrong, especially Eller's.  
Feel free to submit a PR to any of the algorithms if that's the case!
